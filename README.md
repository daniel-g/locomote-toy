# Locomote Toy

This small project were built taking into account the game described [here](https://gist.github.com/owenbyrne/a478edfaa0ef0f554beccdac9b2f1cd2#things-to-keep-in-mind)

In order for this to work, clone this repo, and run the play script like this:

```
./play sample/instructions_1.txt
```

Bests!
